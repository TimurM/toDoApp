Angular Shopping List Instructions

1) Replace the hardcoded shopping list with items retrieved from the mock REST endpoint: http://demo3374525.mockable.io/shopping-list
   There are no mock REST endpoints for adding or deleting items so you can just maintain this data locally in $shoppingService

2) Add functionality to remove items from the shopping list

3) Add functionality to add new items to the shopping list

4) Add functionality to sorting the items by name or type by clicking on the table header links

Notes: Feel free to use any online resources to assist you.
